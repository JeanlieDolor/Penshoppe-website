							<h2 class="blog-post-title">EVERYBODY HAS A STORY WITH PENSHOPPE </h2>
							<p class="blog-post-meta">believe everybody has a Penshoppe story. Mine was quite a roller coaster ride. It had ups and downs. But what that story gave me was a life lesson - that when something ends, a new one begins. Just like Penshoppe. For a time, Penshoppe in Ayala Center Cebu closed and was relaocated for a major renovation. And just a few days ago, Penshoppe reopened to the public. It was well attended by the fashion people of Cebu. From the hippest fashion bloggers to the loyal patrons of Penshoppe. With a wide variety of fashion knick knacks and closet basics, I say Penshoppe in Ayala Center Cebu definitely did not disappoint and came out bigger and better. Itâ€™s like a new transformation from someone who took a break and is now ready to take on the world. (I think I am describing myself in that sentence.) I feel like a lot has changed since the last time we were together in Penshoppe. I went back to my passion in writing and has made myself a fashion and lifestyle blogger. I have met amazing people in Cebu who I share the same passion with. And I can say now that the past is all in the past. Well, if you are reading this. Don't worry I still remember you.</a></p>
